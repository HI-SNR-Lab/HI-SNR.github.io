Dhruva (KF0UJO) is a Graduate student at the Ann & HJ Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is currently a researcher at HI SNR Lab. Before graduate school he served as a Scientist‑Engineer at Indian Space Research Organization’s Space Applications Center, leading the development of a digital‑beamforming GEO payload and devising polyphase channel‑reconstruction algorithms. He also led the CubeSat communications team and the INSPIRESat‑1 commissioning campaign at the Small Spacecraft Systems and Payload Centre (SSPACE) at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, and a recipient of the Department of Space Scholarship (2018-2022). Dhruva’s interests span multi-static radar, small‑sat clusters and FPGA‑based real time processing, and—when away from the lab—he can be found making elegant PCB's.
