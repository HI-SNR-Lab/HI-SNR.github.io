Eric Gosnell is a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a minor in Computer Engineering and a certificate in Geographic Information Science. He is currently an undergraduate Research Assistant in the Imaging and Multistatic-radar Group where he is developing both the open-source software platform and physical hardware for an ice-penetrating, software-defined radar system. Previously, Eric worked as a Snow Hydrology Research Intern with the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research measuring snow stratigraphy data in remote, high elevation locations. He is primarily interested in cryospheric and geoscientific applications of computer science and electrical engineering. Eric has received multiple scholarships, including the Horace M. Hale Esteemed Scholar Award. After graduation, he intends to pursue his M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder, which is expected in May of 2027.
