Piper Morison is an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder, expected to graduate in 2028 and then pursue an accelerated masterâ€™s in the same field. She is currently an undergraduate researcher with the HI-SNR Lab, where she is developing and integrating features for the open-source ORCA radar codebase used in cryosphere research. Piper was also active in the Photon Pioneers project group, where she helped design a low-power Safe Light Sensing System that alerts users with photophobia to hazardous ambient light levels.

Piper has received multiple honors, including membership in the CU Engineering Honors Society and Tau Beta Pi with scholarships from the Society of Women Engineers, the BOLD Center for Diversity, Cemex, and many more. Her research interests include embedded and power systems, but she is enthusiastic about exploring a variety of fields within electrical engineering to broaden her expertise and discover the area that best aligns with her skills and passions.
