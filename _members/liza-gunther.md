Liza Gunther is a master’s student in Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado. In the HI SNR lab, she is researching how to better estimate water resources stored in snow by using synthetic aperture radar. Prior to graduate school, she worked as a staff scientist at Quantum Catalyzer, where she contributed to the development and commercialization of quantum sensors, primarily for wide-field magnetic field imaging. Liza earned her B.S. in Physics with high honors and a minor in Sustainability from the University of Maryland (UMD). As an undergraduate, she researched nitrogen-vacancy centers and the design capabilities of the Quantum Diamond Microscope at the Institute of Optics and in the Walsworth Group at UMD. She also researched the electrostatics of few-atom quantum devices at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Liza has a strong interest in applying optical and RF technologies to environmental sensing. In her free time, you can find her drinking chai lattes, swimming, biking, and re-learning how to run.
