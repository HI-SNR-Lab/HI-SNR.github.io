Carson Anderson is a Master’s student at CU Boulder and a new member of the HI-SNR Lab, where he will be working on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) analysis, exploitation, and change detection. His academic interests include remote sensing, SAR image processing, and machine learning for geospatial applications.
Previously, Carson conducted array signal processing research focused on near-field acoustic denoising, contributed to an NSF-funded project applying deep learning to inverter-based power grid operations, and worked on a wavelet-based denoising project for SAR imagery. He is also a member of the Critical Skills Master’s Fellowship at Sandia National Laboratories, where he developed embedded systems and user interfaces for triboelectric test equipment. He continues his fellowship at Sandia, currently supporting hardware-in-the-loop simulations for advanced radar environments.
As an undergraduate, he served as an engineering council representative for Tau Beta Pi at New Mexico State University, supporting outreach events, campus improvement projects, and student program funding efforts. Outside of research, Carson enjoys hiking, mountain biking, and exploring national parks.
