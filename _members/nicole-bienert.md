Nicole Bienert is an Assistant Professor of Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the PI of the Imaging and Multistatic-radar Group. She previously was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, researching drone-based soil moisture tomography under Mahta Moghaddam. Nicole spent time in industry, developing equitable imaging algorithms at Google as a member of the Pixel team. Nicole received her Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University under Dustin Schroeder, a radar glaciology expert, where she researched Multistatic Radar Tomography for estimating englacial thermal distributions. Her work earned the 2020 IGARSS Prize Paper Award and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Nicole spent time as a Visiting Graduate Researcher with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where she investigated orthogonal-wave beamforming for a CubeSat swarm sounder. Nicole received her B.S. degree (cum laude) in electrical engineering with a minor in physics from the Schreyer Honors College at The Pennsylvania State University. During undergraduate internships at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Nicole researched resonance radar imaging for estimating aquifer volume and developed an inflatable antenna to enable deep-space CubeSats.
