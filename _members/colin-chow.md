Colin Chow is a sophomore Electrical and Computer Science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, with an expected graduation date of 2028. He is currently an undergraduate researcher in Professor Bienert's HI-SNR lab, adding functionality to the ORCA (Open Radar Code Architecture) codebase. This codebase is meant to allow widespread radar data collection on ice sheets and glaciers, and to make it easier for all cryosphere researchers to put together their own projects. He was previously the winner of a CU Boulder design expo contest, in which he helped create a wearable radar headband that could be used by blind people to detect obstacles in their way. His future plans are to pursue an accelerated master's in electrical engineering and a minor in business. Colin's academic interests are space exploration, artificial intelligence, and radar, and his hobbies outside of school include rock climbing, reading, and coding for fun.
