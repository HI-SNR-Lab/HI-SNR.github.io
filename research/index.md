The Imaging and Multistatic-radar Group (IMG) develops data assimilation, computational imaging, and signal processing methods in two areas:

<details close>
<summary>1. Multistatic Radar for Environmental Applications?</summary>
<br>
We develop multistatic radars and algorithms for retreiving properties of the environment for the following purposes:
  1. Equip scientists with the tools needed to improve our understanding of the environment. We develop radar-based methods for making measurements of environmental processes at a quality or scale that is not possible with existing tools. This includes projects such as generating 2D maps of the temperature distribution inside glaciers.
  2. Develop systems than enable resource monitoring and improved resource management. This includes projects such as monitoring soil moisture for improved irrigaiton practices.  

  We are a crib to grave team that puts environmental solutions into the hands of scientists and and environmental agencies.

<summary>2. Computational Photography?</summary>
<br>
We develop computational photography algorithms that improve image quality and make camera performance more equitable.

2020 IGARSS Prize Paper Award Winner

[Processing-Based Synchronization Approach for Bistatic Radar Glacial Tomography](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9323969)

This novel processing based synchronization approach allows coherent long-offset radar processing. This is a key enabling technology for radar tomography of glaciers.
